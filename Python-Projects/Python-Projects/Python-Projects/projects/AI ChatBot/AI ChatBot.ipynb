      ">>  Python is a popular high-level programming language that was first released in 1991. It is known for its simplicity and readability, making it easy for beginners to learn and use. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its extensive standard library, providing a wide range of modules and packages for various tasks such as web development, data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key features of Python is its emphasis on code readability, which is achieved through its use of indentation and a clean syntax that reduces the use of unnecessary symbols. This allows programmers to write code that is more concise and easier to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Python is cross-platform compatible and can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is also an interpreted language, meaning that it can be executed line by line without the need for prior compilation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its versatility and application in various fields. It is widely used by big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix, as well as in academia, research, and small-scale projects due to its vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and community support.\n",

    "1. **Import Statements:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - `import requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to the API.\n",
    "   - `import pyfiglet`: Used for creating ASCII art text.\n",
    "   - `import itertools`: Used to cycle through a list of characters for creating an animation.\n",
    "   - `import threading`: Used to run the animation in a separate thread.\n",
    "   - `import time`: Used for introducing delays.\n",
    "   - `import sys`: Used for system-related functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **API Configuration:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - The `url` variable contains the endpoint URL of the remote API used for chatbot responses.\n",
    "   - The `headers` dictionary contains the necessary headers for making requests to the API, including the API key and  \n",
    "      host.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Animation Function (`animate`):**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - A function that creates an animated loading spinner using characters like `|`, `/`, `-`, and `\\`.\n",
    "   - The animation continues until the `done` variable becomes `True`.\n",
    "   - This function runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Chatbot Function (`ask`):**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - Accepts a `question` parameter.\n",
    "   - Constructs a JSON payload with the question.\n",
    "   - Sends a POST request to the API with the question and headers.\n",
    "   - Retrieves the API response as JSON and extracts the \"answer\" field from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Main Execution (`__name__ == \"__main__\"`):**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - Prints an ASCII art banner \"AI Chat BOT\".\n",
    "   - Prompts the user to enter a question.\n",
    "   - Enters a loop that continues to prompt the user for questions until the user enters 'q'.\n",
    "   - Inside the loop:\n",
    "     - The animation is started in a separate thread.\n",
    "     - The `ask` function is called with the user's question to fetch an answer from the API.\n",
    "     - The animation thread is signaled to stop, and the main thread waits for it to complete.\n",
    "     - The retrieved answer is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **User Interaction Loop:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - The program enters a loop where the user can input questions.\n",
    "   - If the user enters 'q', the program displays a farewell message and exits the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Animation Control (`done`):\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - The `done` flag is used to control the animation loop. It is set to `False` \n",
    "\tbefore starting the animation and set to `True` when the animation is meant to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Program Flow:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - The user inputs a question.\n",
    "   - An animation thread is started to display a loading spinner.\n",
    "   - The program sends the question to the API using the `ask` function.\n",
    "   - The animation thread is stopped, and the answer is displayed after a brief delay.\n",
